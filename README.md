# National Park Explorer

# Description
National Park Explorer is an app where visitors can explore and find out more information about the top National Parks in the United States. The list is sorted from Most to Least Likes as rated by our visitors. Visitors can also add their own comments about each park to help others with planning out their next trip to the National Parks. Finally visitors are able to add in new National Parks by providing all of the necessary information. This app was built using React/Redux Front-End and Ruby on Rails API Back-End.
